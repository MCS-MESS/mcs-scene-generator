# Seeing leads to knowing:
# 1. The performer agent starts with four open containers in view.
# 2. An agent will then walk into view.
# 3. Placers will descend into each container, with only one having
#    the soccer ball.
# 4. After the placers are finished moving, the agent will attempt to go to the
#    container that has the target object.
# 5. The performer agent will then have to pick whether the scene is plausible
#    or implausible based on the agent's behavior
# Note that the ILE only generates plausible scenes.
shortcut_seeing_leads_to_knowing:
    # Note that, if `target_behind_agent` is True, the agent will guess one
    # of the two containers placed behind itself. This behavior is plausible.
    target_behind_agent: [True, False]

# Override defaults to avoid randomly generating any objects.
