# Add a Multi Retrieval goal with one to five identical soccer balls as the
# target objects. The performer agent must pick up all targets to succeed.
# All target objects will be positioned on either the left side or the right
# side of the room, adjacent to each other. Other identical soccer balls will
# be positioned on the opposite side of the room, but in lesser quantity. Only
# the soccer balls on the side with more soccer balls are considered "targets".
# Furthermore, some soccer balls will either be added to or removed from the
# scene; you must add or subtract in order to identify the correct side.
