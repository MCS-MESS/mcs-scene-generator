# Generate an Imitation scene:
# - Room has a variable rectangular size.
# - Performer agent starts with a specific position/rotation.
# - Three closed containers (same size and shape, different colors) are
#   positioned in a line, in view of the performer agent.
# - Another agent in the scene opens one or two containers in a specific order.
# - A placer holding the target object (soccer ball) descends from the ceiling
#   and releases the ball.
# - Performer agent is kidnaped; it and/or the containers may be repositioned.
# - Containers are closed and placer holding target object is reset.
# - Performer agent must open the containers in the correct order to trigger
#   the placer and pick up the target object.
# Please see the ILE_API.md for details on shortcut_imitation_task.
